# Vaastman Backend — Admin Module API Documentation

This document describes every endpoint defined in the Admin router of the Vaastman Backend. It covers purpose, request/response shapes, validation rules (as implemented or inferred from validators/controllers), authentication, and examples. The admin router is mounted under the main API prefix:

- Base path (server): /api/v1
- Admin router mount: /api/v1/admin
- Therefore each route below is the full path prefixed with /api/v1.

Notes about source/behavior
- The documentation below is produced from the repository's admin route and admin controller (and related validators). Where a controller or validator explicitly defines the shape/behavior, that is documented precisely. Where only the Prisma model or controller usage implies structure, fields are marked as inferred.
- The admin router in the source contains a commented line that would enable middleware to protect routes and restrict to ADMIN users:
  - // router.use(protect, restrictTo("ADMIN"));
  - Intended behavior: Admin routes should be protected by JWT-based authentication and restricted to role `ADMIN`. However, in the current codebase this line is commented out; verify that your deployment enables authentication before production use.

Common headers and responses
- Common request headers:
  - Content-Type: application/json (for JSON bodies)
  - Authorization: Bearer <access_token> (for protected endpoints — see each endpoint)
- Typical success envelope used by controllers:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "data": { /* resource or object */ }
}
```
- Error responses:
  - Controllers throw `AppError` with a statusCode and message. The global error handler returns JSON like:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message"
}
```
- Status codes:
  - 200 OK — successful read / updates in many controllers
  - 201 Created — resource creation (e.g., creating an employee)
  - 400 Bad Request — validation or business rule failure
  - 401 Unauthorized — authentication required (middleware)
  - 403 Forbidden — insufficient permissions
  - 404 Not Found — resource not found
  - 500 Internal Server Error — unexpected errors

Authentication & Authorization
- Intended authentication: JWT access tokens generated by Auth module.
- How to include: set Authorization header:
  - Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
- Intended authorization: `restrictTo("ADMIN")` should apply to all admin routes. Confirm middleware is enabled in your deployment.

---

## GET /admin/dashboard

- Full path: GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard
- Description: Returns aggregated counts for the admin dashboard (totals for employees, universities, colleges, students, certificates).
- Authentication: Intended to require ADMIN access (Authorization: Bearer <token>).
  - Note: middleware was present but commented out in the router — ensure `protect` and `restrictTo("ADMIN")` are enabled.

Request
- No path, query, or body parameters.

Success response
- Status: 200 OK
- Example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Admin dashboard data fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "totalEmployees": 12,
    "totalUniversities": 3,
    "totalColleges": 14,
    "totalStudents": 423,
    "totalCertificates": 1200
  }
}
```

Response fields
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| totalEmployees | integer | Number of users with role EMPLOYEE |
| totalUniversities | integer | Number of universities |
| totalColleges | integer | Number of colleges |
| totalStudents | integer | Number of students |
| totalCertificates | integer | Number of certificates |

Errors
- 401 Unauthorized — if authentication middleware enabled and token missing/invalid
- 500 Internal Server Error — on DB or unexpected errors

---

## POST /admin/employees

- Full path: POST /api/v1/admin/employees
- Description: Create a new employee user (role `EMPLOYEE`) — admin-managed employee creation.
- Authentication: Intended ADMIN-only (Authorization: Bearer <token>)

Validation (inferred / controller usage)
- Controller expects body to contain: name, email, password, mobile.
- Validator referenced: `employeeValidator.createEmployeeSchema` — ensures appropriate types and constraints (name length, valid email, password min length, mobile digits).
- On conflict: if email already exists, returns 400.

Request body
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| name | string | Yes | min/max lengths enforced by validator |
| email | string | Yes | must be a valid email |
| password | string | Yes | plain password; hashed server-side |
| mobile | string | No | typically 10 digits if provided |

Example request
```json
{
  "name": "Alice Employee",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPass123",
  "mobile": "9876543210"
}
```

Success response
- Status: 201 Created
- Example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid-of-created-user",
    "name": "Alice Employee",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "mobile": "9876543210",
    "role": "EMPLOYEE",
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2025-10-25T08:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-25T08:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Response fields (data)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| id | string (UUID) | Unique user id |
| name | string | Employee name |
| email | string | Employee email |
| mobile | string or null | Optional |
| role | string | "EMPLOYEE" |
| isActive | boolean | true/false |
| createdAt | string (ISO) | created timestamp |
| updatedAt | string (ISO) | updated timestamp |

Errors
- 400 Bad Request — "Employee already exists" (email conflict)
- 400 Validation errors — missing/invalid fields
- 401 Unauthorized — if authentication middleware applied and unauthorized
- 500 Server error — DB issues

Notes
- Password is hashed with bcrypt before being stored.
- The created response includes the user object but should never include the password hash — controllers should ensure password is not returned. (The controller is creating `newEmployee` and returns it; verify sanitizer.)

Success response

# Validation references (where validators are applied in route)
- Employees:
  - createEmployeeSchema (body) — validates name, email, password, mobile
  - employeeIdParamSchema (params) — validates :id (UUID)
- University:
  - createUniversitySchema (body)
  - updateUniversitySchema (body)
  - universityIdParamSchema (params)
- College:
  - createCollegeSchema (body)
  - updateCollegeSchema (body)
  - collegeIdParamSchema (params)
- Certificates:
  - No explicit validator referenced in router for certificates in the adminRoute snippet; controllers handle inputs. Add Joi validation for cert endpoints for robust validation.

Check the validators directory for the exact Joi schemas referenced by router:
- src/validators/employeeValidation.js
- src/validators/universityValidaton.js
- src/validators/collegeValidation.js

(If these files need updates to reflect the controllers precisely, update them to enforce required/optional fields.)

---

# Errors and status conventions (recommendations)
- Use 401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid Authorization headers (current code sometimes throws 400 for missing auth headers).
- Return 204 No Content for successful DELETE operations if no body is required.
- On create/update endpoints return minimal safe objects (exclude sensitive fields like user.password).
- Standardize a response envelope — controllers mostly follow { success, message, data } pattern.

---

# Security & operational notes
- Ensure that admin routes are protected by `protect` middleware and `restrictTo("ADMIN")` to prevent accidental public access. The router contains the line:
```js
// router.use(protect, restrictTo("ADMIN"));
```
which must be enabled for production.
- Ensure returned user objects do not contain hashed passwords.
- Consider adding pagination on list endpoints (employees, colleges, students) if results grow.
- Add request validators for certificate endpoints to avoid invalid DB writes.
